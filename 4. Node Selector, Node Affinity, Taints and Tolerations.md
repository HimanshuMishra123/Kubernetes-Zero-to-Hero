## Kubernetes Node Selector, Node Affinity, Taints, and Tolerations

### Node Selector
**Concept:**
Node Selector is a simple way to constrain pods to nodes with specific labels. It allows the Kubernetes scheduler to schedule pods only on nodes that have a matching label.

**Implementation:**
1. **Add a Label to the Node:**
   ```bash
   kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>
   ```
2. **Specify the Node Selector in the Pod Specification:**
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: nginx
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: nginx
       image: nginx
     nodeSelector:
       <label-key>: <label-value>
    # nodeSelector field ensures that the pod will only be scheduled on nodes that have the label <label-key>: <label-value> which you hardcode here or pass that in command line
   ```

**Example:**
To ensure a pod is scheduled on a node with the label `node-name=arm-worker`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  nodeSelector:
    node-name: arm-worker
```
This configuration ensures that the pod will only run on a node labeled with `node-name=arm-worker`. If no such node exists, the pod remains in the pending state .

### Node Affinity
**Concept:**
Node Affinity provides more flexible and expressive ways to specify where pods can be scheduled(on which nodes your pod is eligible to be scheduled on). It supports both required and preferred scheduling rules.

**Types of Node Affinity:**
1. **Required During Scheduling, Ignored During Execution:**
   - Ensures that the pod will only be scheduled on nodes that match the criteria.
   - This is a hard requirement. If the conditions are not met, the pod won't be scheduled.
   - Example: Only schedule pods on nodes with the label disktype=ssd.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: nginx
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: nginx
       image: nginx
     affinity:
       nodeAffinity:
         requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
           nodeSelectorTerms:
           - matchExpressions:
             - key: <label-key>
               operator: In
               values:
               - <label-value>
   ```

2. **Preferred During Scheduling, Ignored During Execution:**
   - This is a soft requirement. Kubernetes will try to schedule the pod on nodes that match the affinity rules, but if none are available, it will still schedule the pod elsewhere on other nodes which are available.
   - Example: Prefer nodes with region=us-west-1, but allow scheduling on other nodes if necessary.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: nginx
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: nginx
       image: nginx
     affinity:
       nodeAffinity:
         preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
         - weight: 1
           preference:
             matchExpressions:
             - key: <label-key>
               operator: In
               values:
               - <label-value>
   ```

**Example:**
To prefer a node with `node-architecture=Windows`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 1
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: node-architecture
            operator: In
            values:
            - Windows
```
If no such node is available, the pod may be scheduled on any other node .

### Taints and Tolerations
**Concept:**
Taints and Tolerations work together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. Taints are applied to nodes, and tolerations are applied to pods. and that allow (tolerate) the pod to be scheduled onto nodes with matching taints.

**Taints:**
1. **NoSchedule:**
   This command adds a taint to the node `<node-name>` with the key `key`, the value `value`, and the effect `NoSchedule`. This means no pod will be scheduled on this node unless the pod has a toleration for this taint.
   ```bash
   kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:NoSchedule
   ```
2. **PreferNoSchedule:**
   Tries to avoid scheduling new pods on the node if possible.
   ```bash
   kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:PreferNoSchedule
   ```
3. **NoExecute:**
   Evicts existing pods and ensures no new pods are scheduled on the node.
   ```bash
   kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:NoExecute
   ```

**Tolerations:**
Tolerations are added to pods to allow them to be scheduled on nodes with matching taints.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  tolerations:
  - key: <key>
    operator: "Equal"
    value: <value>
    effect: <NoSchedule|PreferNoSchedule|NoExecute>
```

**Example:**
To allow a pod to be scheduled on a node with the taint `key1=value1:NoSchedule`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  tolerations:
  - key: "key1"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value1"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```
This configuration permits the pod to tolerate the `NoSchedule` taint and thus be scheduled on the node despite the taint    .


## Example of Multiple Tolerations
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-tolerant-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  tolerations:
  - key: "key1"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value1"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  - key: "key2"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value2"
    effect: "NoExecute"
```
In this example, the pod `multi-tolerant-pod` has two tolerations. It can be scheduled onto nodes with the `key1=value1:NoSchedule` taint and can also run on nodes with the `key2=value2:NoExecute taint`.

### Summary
- **Node Selector:** Directly assigns pods to nodes with specific labels.
- **Node Affinity:** Offers more flexibility with preferred and required scheduling rules.
- **Taints and Tolerations:** Prevent or allow pods to be scheduled on nodes with certain taints, providing more control over pod placement and node usage during operations like maintenance or upgrades.
